This file describes the MobyDick package.

The package loads a tibble with the text of Moby Dick along with line number, the section of text our line is found, and the chapter number.

The MobyDick package can be installed by running:

```
devtools::install_github("STAT325-S24/MobyDick")
library(MobyDick)
```

```{r}
# glimpse(DiscGolf)
```

This README will soon include some interesting analyses.
