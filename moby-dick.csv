"Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin",752,"text",1,8
"to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my",753,"text",1,8
"lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a",754,"text",1,8
"passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a",755,"text",1,8
"purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers",756,"text",1,8
"get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy",757,"text",1,8

"nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a",759,"text",1,8
"Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction",760,"text",1,8
"of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all",761,"text",1,8

"buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who",768,"text",1,8

"True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to",776,"text",1,9
"spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of",777,"text",1,9
"thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,",778,"text",1,9
"particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the",779,"text",1,9
"van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if",780,"text",1,9
"just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been",781,"text",1,9
"lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in",782,"text",1,9
"awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from the",783,"text",1,9
"schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and",784,"text",1,9
"the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off",785,"text",1,9
"in time.",786,"text",1,9
"",787,"text",1,10
"What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom",788,"text",1,10
"and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,",789,"text",1,10
"I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel",790,"text",1,10
"Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and",791,"text",1,10
"respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who aint",792,"text",1,10
"a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may",793,"text",1,10
"order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the",794,"text",1,10
"satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is",795,"text",1,10

"and be content.",799,"text",1,10
"",800,"text",1,11
"Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of",801,"text",1,11
"paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single",802,"text",1,11
"penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must",803,"text",1,11
"pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and",804,"text",1,11
"being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable",805,"text",1,11
"infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being",806,"text",1,11
"paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man",807,"text",1,11
"receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly",808,"text",1,11
"believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no",809,"text",1,11
"account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign",810,"text",1,11
"ourselves to perdition!",811,"text",1,11
"",812,"text",1,12
"Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome",813,"text",1,12
"exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck. For as in this world,",814,"text",1,12
"head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if",815,"text",1,12
"you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the",816,"text",1,12
"Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from",817,"text",1,12
"the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not",818,"text",1,12
"so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many",819,"text",1,12
"other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But",820,"text",1,12
"wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a",821,"text",1,12
"merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling",822,"text",1,12
"voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the",823,"text",1,12
"constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in",824,"text",1,12
"some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,",825,"text",1,12
"doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand",826,"text",1,12
"programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in",827,"text",1,12
"as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive",828,"text",1,12
"performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run",829,"text",1,12

"Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when",837,"text",1,14
"others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short",838,"text",1,14
"and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I",839,"text",1,14
"cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the",840,"text",1,14
"circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives",841,"text",1,14
"which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced",842,"text",1,14
"me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the",843,"text",1,14

"and discriminating judgment.",845,"text",1,14
"",846,"text",1,15
"Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale",847,"text",1,15
"himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my",848,"text",1,15
"curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island",849,"text",1,15
"bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all",850,"text",1,15
"the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,",851,"text",1,15
"helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things",852,"text",1,15
"would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an",853,"text",1,15
"everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and",854,"text",1,15
"land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to",855,"text",1,15
"perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let",856,"text",1,15

"By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the",860,"text",1,16
"great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild",861,"text",1,16
"conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into",862,"text",1,16

"arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city",873,"text",2,22
"of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was on a Saturday",874,"text",2,22
"night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the",875,"text",2,22

"be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was",881,"text",2,23
"made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a",882,"text",2,23
"fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous",883,"text",2,23
"old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has",884,"text",2,23
"of late been gradually monopolizing the business of whaling, and though",885,"text",2,23
"in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket",886,"text",2,23
"was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the",887,"text",2,23

"Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me",896,"text",2,24
"in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a",897,"text",2,24
"matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a",898,"text",2,24
"very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold",899,"text",2,24
"and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had",900,"text",2,24
"sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,",901,"text",2,24
"wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of",902,"text",2,24

"while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,",1417,"text",3,93
"he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was",1418,"text",3,93
"of a dark purplish, yellow color, here and there stuck over with large,",1419,"text",3,93
"blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible",1420,"text",3,93
"bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,",1421,"text",3,93
"just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face",1422,"text",3,93
"so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be",1423,"text",3,93
"sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were",1424,"text",3,93
"stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;",1425,"text",3,93
"but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story",1426,"text",3,93
"of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had",1427,"text",3,93
"been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course",1428,"text",3,93
"of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And",1429,"text",3,93
"what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be",1430,"text",3,93
"honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly",1431,"text",3,93
"complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely",1432,"text",3,93
"independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be",1433,"text",3,93
"nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot",1434,"text",3,93
"sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had",1435,"text",3,93
"never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these",1436,"text",3,93
"extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were",1437,"text",3,93
"passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at",1438,"text",3,93
"all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced",1439,"text",3,93
"fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a",1440,"text",3,93
"seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in",1441,"text",3,93
"the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly",1442,"text",3,93
"thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his",1443,"text",3,93
"hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.",1444,"text",3,93
"There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a",1445,"text",3,93
"small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now",1446,"text",3,93
"looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger",1447,"text",3,93
"stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker",1448,"text",3,93

"head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.",1453,"text",3,94
"Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and",1454,"text",3,94
"confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of",1455,"text",3,94

"",1460,"text",3,95
"Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed",1461,"text",3,95
"his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were",1462,"text",3,95
"checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all",1463,"text",3,95
"over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’",1464,"text",3,95
"War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still",1465,"text",3,95
"more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs",1466,"text",3,95
"were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that",1467,"text",3,95
"he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman",1468,"text",3,95
"in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to",1469,"text",3,95
"think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own",1470,"text",3,95
"brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!",1471,"text",3,95

"But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about",1473,"text",3,96
"something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me",1474,"text",3,96
"that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,",1475,"text",3,96
"or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in",1476,"text",3,96
"the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image",1477,"text",3,96
"with a hunch on its back, and exactly the color of a three days’ old",1478,"text",3,96
"Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought",1479,"text",3,96
"that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar",1480,"text",3,96
"manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened",1481,"text",3,96
"a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing",1482,"text",3,96
"but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage",1483,"text",3,96
"goes up to the empty fireplace, and removing the papered fire-board,",1484,"text",3,96
"sets up this little hunchbacked image, like a tenpin, between the",1485,"text",3,96
"andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,",1486,"text",3,96
"so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine",1487,"text",3,96
"or chapel for his Congo idol.",1488,"text",3,96
"",1489,"text",3,97
"I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but",1490,"text",3,97
"ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes",1491,"text",3,97
"about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places",1492,"text",3,97
"them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on",1493,"text",3,97
"top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into",1494,"text",3,97
"a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the",1495,"text",3,97
"fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed",1496,"text",3,97
"to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the",1497,"text",3,97
"biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite",1498,"text",3,97
"offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to",1499,"text",3,97
"fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these",1500,"text",3,97
"strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from",1501,"text",3,97

"some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in",1503,"text",3,97

"chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there",4917,"text",26,628
"were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some",4918,"text",26,628
"cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly",4919,"text",26,628
"conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,",4920,"text",26,628

"organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than",4923,"text",26,628
"from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And",4924,"text",26,628
"if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more",4925,"text",26,628
"did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,",4926,"text",26,628
"tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,",4927,"text",26,628

"honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often",4929,"text",26,628

"all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in",4944,"text",26,630

"of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly",4946,"text",26,630

"Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,",5013,"text",27,639

"whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his",5019,"text",27,639

"the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very",5022,"text",27,639
"death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and",5023,"text",27,639

"old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated",5025,"text",27,639

"was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic",5063,"text",27,642
